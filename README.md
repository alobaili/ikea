# ikea
AR app similar to ikea built with ARKit and SceneKit. The app imitates adding objects to planes, resizing them with the pinch gesture, selecting them with long press gesture, and rotating the selected objects with the rotation gesture.

## Trying the app
You need at least XCode 10.2 and an iOS 12.2 enabled device to try the app. Just open the XCode project, connect the iOS device, select the device from the top left corner (next to the play button) and run it by hitting âŒ˜+R.
